# BankStatementRetriever MVP - Orchestration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation approach for the BankStatementRetriever MVP, based on the PRD requirements.

## Simplified Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js dashboard on Vercel
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers for API and processing
- **Database**: Supabase for auth and data
- **Zero Storage**: Direct streaming from Plaid to destinations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Status**: In Progress
**Duration**: 3-5 days

Tasks:

1. ✅ GitHub repository setup
2. ⏳ Supabase project initialization
3. ⏳ Cloudflare Workers setup
4. ⏳ Basic authentication flow

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

**Duration**: 5-7 days

Tasks:

1. Plaid integration for bank linking
2. Statement polling mechanism (2 AM ET daily)
3. File delivery to Google Drive
4. Webhook destination with HMAC signing

### Phase 3: User Experience

**Duration**: 5-7 days

Tasks:

1. Dashboard for connection management
2. Manual sync and backfill features
3. Email notifications
4. Basic error handling

## Agent Coordination

### Current Focus

The orchestrator is currently working on Phase 1 foundation tasks. The next steps are:

1. **Database Setup** - Create Supabase schema based on PRD Section 7
2. **Worker Infrastructure** - Set up Cloudflare Workers with cron triggers
3. **Authentication** - Implement basic email/password auth

### Integration Points

Each component has clear interfaces:

- Dashboard → Workers API (REST)
- Workers → Supabase (Database)
- Workers → Plaid (Statements)
- Workers → Storage Providers (OAuth)
- Workers → Webhooks (HMAC)

### Success Criteria (MVP)

1. User can link a bank account via Plaid
2. Statements are automatically retrieved daily
3. Files are delivered to chosen destination
4. Dashboard shows connection health
5. Email notifications work

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Create Supabase database schema
2. Initialize Cloudflare Workers project
3. Set up Next.js dashboard scaffold
4. Implement basic authentication

## Notes

- Following simplified approach per complexity review
- Avoiding over-engineering and premature optimization
- Building incrementally with working software at each step
- Deferring enterprise features to post-MVP
